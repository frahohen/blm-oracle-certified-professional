## Major Components of Java

* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
  
  * <u>Compiler (javac)</u> =>
    * .java files to .class files (bytecode)
  * <u>Launcher (java)</u> =>
    * creates Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and executes the program
  * <u>Archiver (jar)</u> =>
    * packages files together
  * <u>API documentation (javadoc)</u> =>
    * generates documentation

* **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**
  
  * Used to run a program, but not to compile it (subset of JDK)
  * In older versions jre folder exists
  * Java 11 uses JDK and no stand-alone or subdirectory for JRE functionality
  * jlink creates executable that contains the pieces of the JRE to run a program

* **Java Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**
  
  * A lot of APIs contained within the language like StringBuilder, Collections etc

* **Integrated Development Enviornments (IDE) used for Java development**
  
  * Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, Netbeans
